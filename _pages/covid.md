# Model

<p>
    <img src="../assets/images/COVID/COVIDmodel.png" width="1000" height="600" />
</p>


We propose an extended version of the SEIRS modeled exploiting the Petri Net formalism  to account for the population age distribution, that was classified into three groups: young individuals 0-19 years,  adults 20-69 years, old adults aged at least 70 years.
The following figure shows:

1.  (A) The transmission flow diagram of our age-dependent SEIRS model, where the circles represent population partitions and the arcs describe the disease progression.
2.  (B) Age-specific and location-specific contact matrices. The intense of the color indicates higher propensity of making the contact.
3.  (C) Distribution of quarantine infected (Iq), hospitalized infected (Ih) and deaths (D) from February 24th to May 2nd. The control strategies are reported below the bar graph.


<p>

</p>

The population of the age class *i* is partitioned in the following
seven compartments: (*S*<sub>*i*</sub>), (*E*<sub>*i*</sub>),
(*I*<sub>*u* *i*</sub>), (*I*<sub>*q* *i*</sub>), (*I*<sub>*h* *i*</sub>),
(*R*<sub>*i*</sub>), (*D*<sub>*i*</sub>). With respect to the classical
SEIRS model, we have added a transition from *I*<sub>*u* *i*</sub> to
*I*<sub>*q* *i*</sub> to model the possibility to identify undetected
cases and isolate them. In this way an individual in
*I*<sub>*u* *i*</sub> tested as positive to the SARS-CoV-2 swab will be
moved in the quarantine regime, *I*<sub>*q* *i*</sub>.


The *force of infection* adopted in the model is a time and age class dependent function and includes the following four terms:

1.  the *infection rate*, depending on the age classes of both the susceptible and the infected individuals who come into contact according to the contact matrix;
2.  the *strength of governmental restriction* defined through a time-depended step function, modeling the severity of the public restrictions;
3.  the *compliance with the  governmental restriction*, reporting how effectively the population adheres to the restriction measures imposed by the Italian government. The higher the disease severity (i.e., the severity of the epidemic in terms of number of deaths and hospitalized individuals in the last 40 days), the better the population compliance;
4.  the *compliance with individual-level measures*, considering how different infection-control measures are properly adopted by the population. 



A detailed description of the model (e.g., system of ordinary differential equations, parameters, etc) is reported in [1].

### Results

The calibration phase was performed to fit the model outcomes with the
surveillance Piedmont infection and death data (from February 24st to
May 2nd) using squared error estimator via trajectory matching. Hence, a
global optimization algorithm, based on (Yang Xiang et al. 2012), was
exploited to estimate 13 model parameters characterized by a high
uncertainty due to their difficulty of being empirically measured:

1.  three parameters represent the probability of infection for each age
    class,
2.  four parameters reflect the governmental action strength,
3.  one parameter describes the intensity of the population response,
4.  two parameters represent the death rate for the hospitalized
    patients,
5.  two parameters are the initial condition for the undetected and
    quarantine infected individuals,
6.  the remainder parameter represents the detection rate for the third
    age class starting from the 1<sup>*s* *t*</sup> April.

Consistently, Figure 2A and 2B show that the calibrated model is able to
mimic consistently the observed infected and death cases (red line
respectively). In details, Figure 2A reports the cumulative trend of the
infected individuals in which the undetected infected are showed in
orange, the quarantine infected in light blue, and hospitalized infected
in blue. The purple line reports the cumulative trend of the undetected
cases diagnosed by SARS-CoV-2 swab tests. Differently Figure 2B shows
the cumulative trend of deaths. In both histograms the surveillance data
are reported as red line. Similarly, in Figure 3 the infected
individuals for each age class are shown.

Studying the effects of the government control interventions.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Three scenarios are implemented. In the the model is calibrated to fit
the surveillance data (yellow). In the the model extends the second
restriction beyond March, 21<sup>*s* *t*</sup> without implementing the
third restriction (blue). In the the model consider a higher population
compliance to the third governmental restriction (green).

COVID-19 epidemic containment strategies.
-----------------------------------------

The daily evolution of infected individuals is shown varying on the
columns the the efficacy of individual-level measures and on the rows
the efficacy of community surveillance.

Figure 5 shows the daily evolution of infected individuals computed by
the stochastic simulation. The stacked bars report the undetected
infected (orange), the quarantine infected (light blue), and
hospitalized infected (blue). The red line shows the trend of the
infected cases from surveillance data. The purple line reports the
cumulative trend of the undetected cases diagnosed by SARS-CoV-2 swab
tests. In Figure 6 we show the daily forecasts of the number of infected
individuals with the efficacy of individual-level measures ranging from
0% to 60% on the columns (increasing by steps of 20%) and, on the rows,
increasing capability (from 0% to 30%, by 10% steps) of identifying
otherwise undetected infected individuals. These results are obtained as
median value of 5000 traces for each scenario obtained from the
stochastic simulation.
