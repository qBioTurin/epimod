## Docker

You need to have docker installed on your machine, for more info see this document:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/.

Ensure your user has the rights to run docker (witout the use of ```sudo```). To create the docker group and add your user:

* Create the docker group.

```
  $ sudo groupadd docker
```
* Add your user to the docker group.

```
  $ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
* Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.
