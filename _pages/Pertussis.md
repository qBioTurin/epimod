### Pertussis Model

![](../assets/images/Pertussis/PertussisModel.png)

We now describe how the framework functions can be combined to obtain an
analysis workflow for the Pertussis model introduced in the main paper:
*A computational framework for modeling andstudying pertussis
epidemiology and vaccination*.

We first introduce all the functions, the constants, and the numerical
values associated with the general transitions rate (the black boxes in
figure ). Then, we show the proposed framework and how it can be
successfully used to study and analyze pertussis infection and the
relative vaccination cycle in Italy. All the details regarding the
function associated to the general transition and the parameters
exploited in the simulations are reported in the *ReadMe.pdf* into the
folder **pdf**.
