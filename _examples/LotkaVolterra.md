The Lotka–Volterra equations are a pair of first-order nonlinear differential equations, frequently used to describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two species interact, one as a predator and the other as prey. This simple model is presented as an introduction to the **GreatMod** usage, showing step by step the base functionalities of the R package, *epimod*. 

The Lotka–Volterra equations, also known as the predator–prey equations,
are a pair of first-order nonlinear differential equations, frequently
used to describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two species
interact, one as a predator and the other as prey ([more information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations)). The populations
change through time according to the pair of equations:

where:

1.  *x* is the number of prey (for example, rabbits);
2.  *y* is the number of some predator (for example, foxes);
3.  $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ and $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ represent the instantaneous
    growth rates of the two populations;
4.  *t* represents time;
5.  *α*, *β*, *γ*, *θ* are positive real parameters describing the
    interaction of the two species.

Model generation

### Sensitivity analysis

The R function *sensitivity\_analysis()* implements the sensitivity
analysis taking as input

1.  the file generated by the *model\_generation* function, the total
    number of samplings to be performed,
2.  the final solution time,
3.  the time step defining the frequency at which explicit estimates for
    the system values are desired,
4.  parameters\_fname (*Functions\_list.csv*): a textual file in which
    the parameters to be studied are listed associated with their range
    of variability. significato delle colonne, e che serve il ; come
    sep, spazi non nei path An example is given by the following file,
    where

<!-- -->

    #>   V1    V2               V3                       V4                     V5
    #> 1  i  init  init_generation  min_init = c(0.9 , 0.8)  max_init = c(1.8 , 2)

1.  functions\_fname (*Functions.R*): …

<!-- -->

    init_generation<-function(min_init , max_init)
    {
        # min/max are vectors = first position interval values for the first place
        # and second position for the second place.

       i_1=runif(n=1,min=min_init[1],max=max_init[1])
       i_2=runif(n=1,min=min_init[2],max=max_init[2])

       return( c(i_1,i_2) )
    }

1.  target\_value\_fname (*Target.R*): … .

Assuming the following fixed rates: *β* = 4/3, *θ* = 1. Than we change
the prey and predator initial conditions from 200 to 1800, and the prey
and predator birth rates *α*, *γ* from 0.1 to 2, knowing that we are
interested to the trajectory generated with the following values:
*x*(0) = 1000, *y*(0) = 500, *α* = 2/3, *γ* = 1.

#### PRCC and ranking

This step is necessary if we are interested to calculate the PRCC to
identify among the input parameters which are the sensitive ones (i.e.,
those that have a great effect on the model behaviour). This may
simplify the calibration step reducing (1) the number of variables to be
estimated and (2) the search space associated with each estimated
parameter.

In order to run the simulations, the user must provide

1.  the reference dataset;
2.  the definition of a function to compute the distance (or error)
    between the models’ output and the reference dataset itself.

In this case the reference dataset is the trajectory obtained from the
starting point 1 predator and 1 prey. Similarly to the previouos step,
we generate different initial conditions for the system but in this
case.

The function defining the distance takes in inputs only the reference
data and the simulation’s output (i.e. a trajectory); an example it
could be the following:

    msqd<-function(reference, output)
    {
        Predator <- output[,"Predator"]
        Prey <- output[,"Prey"]

        diff.Predator <- sum(( Predator - reference[,2] )^2 )
        diff.Prey <- sum(( Prey - reference[,1] )^2 )

        return(diff.Predator+diff.Prey)
    }

where the squared error between the Predator and Prey trajectories
obtaained from the simulation and the corresponding reference
trajectories are calculated, respectively named *diff.Predator* and
*diff.Prey*. Then, the sum of these errors is returned. Our purpose will
be to minimize (see next section) this function in order to identify the
trajectory most similar to the reference data, therefore

    Target<-function(output)
    {
        ret <- output[,"Predator"]
        return(as.data.frame(ret))
    }

Let us note that the name of the distance and target function must have
the same name of the corresponding R file.


    sensitivity<-sensitivity_analysis(n_config = 30,
                                      parameters_fname = "Input/Functions_list.csv",
                                      functions_fname = "Rfunction/Functions.R",

                                      f_time = 20,
                                      s_time = .1)

Running the sensisitivity analysis, we can replicate the results
reported on Wikipedia,
*<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations</a>*.
Indeed, textual file for each generated parameter combination (i.e. 20)
containing the system solution is returned. Each file is characterized
by as many rows as the solution time points (obtained dividing the final
time point by the time step) and as many columns as the system
components. We can now generate the phase-space plot, where it is
possible to see that the predators thrive when there are plentiful prey
but, ultimately, outstrip their food supply and decline. As the predator
population is low, the prey population will increase again. These
dynamics continue in a cycle of growth and decline.

Let us note that it is possible to run the sensitivity analysys without
PRCC or ranking, in the case that we are intersted only on to have a
general idea of the simulation’ results.
